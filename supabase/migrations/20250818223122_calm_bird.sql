-- =========================================================
-- PawPilot HQ â€” Idempotent Storage Buckets & Policies
-- Buckets: avatars, pet_photos, post_media
-- Security:
--   - Public read
--   - Authenticated insert (first folder = auth.uid())
--   - Owner update/delete (same rule)
-- Naming: "<BucketName>: <action description>"
-- =========================================================

-- NOTE: Run this in Supabase SQL Editor or via `supabase db push`
-- as an admin/owner role. Do not run from your application.

-- 1) Ensure buckets exist (idempotent)
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public)
values ('avatars','avatars', true)
on conflict (id) do update set public = excluded.public;

insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public)
values ('pet_photos','pet_photos', true)
on conflict (id) do update set public = excluded.public;

insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public)
values ('post_media','post_media', true)
on conflict (id) do update set public = excluded.public;

-- Helper for ownership by path:
-- (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
